# Supermarket Sales Analytics
 
###Project Overview
This project analyzes a supermarket’s historical sales data to uncover insights about profitability, customer behavior, regional performance, and product trends. It uses real-world datasets (Orders, Returns, Users) to answer key business questions and provide actionable recommendations.
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills: from data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and storytelling, to business recommendations.

###Insights & Findings

-Discounts & Profitability: Higher discounts correlate with negative profit (especially in Technology & Furniture).
Recommendation: Introduce a discount cap to prevent profit erosion.
-Customer Segments: Corporate customers drive bulk sales but lower margins and Home Office customers show higher profitability per unit.
Recommendation: Create a loyalty program for Home Office segment.
-Regional Performance: Central region (Chris) has the most consistent profitability.
East & West suffer from higher return rates, hurting profit.
Recommendation: Share Central’s best practices across regions.
Product Categories
Technology → High sales, inconsistent profit due to returns.
Office Supplies → High volume, low margins.
Furniture → Shipping costs reduce profitability.
Recommendation: Improve Furniture logistics and Technology after-sales support.
